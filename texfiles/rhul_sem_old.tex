\section{RHUL Old Scanning Electron Microscope\label{sec:sem}}
  \iframe{SEM is used to make images, or to trace out the desired pattern loaded from nanomaker. In this section, we describe how to load and prepare the SEM for tasks.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item If vacuum is bad \cmd{\mi{Sample} \ra \mi{Specimen chamber} \ra \mi{stage drawout} \ra \mi{evac}} to pump the machine
	\item If \mi{HT ON} is not working, its because nanomaker has control of the machine. \cmd{Go to nanomaker \ra \mi{File} \ra \mi{Exposure} \ra \mi{Hardware control} \ra \mi{ExtScanOff} \ra \mi{Beam On}}.
	\item If vaccuum system halted \ra \cmd{quit program \ra turn SEM off and then on with key \ra} usual pumping begins;
	\item \begin{itemize} 
		\item \textbf{Aperture 1} for high detailed images. \red{Do not exceed 32 spot size!}
		\item \textbf{Aperture 2} has no restriction on current
	\end{itemize}
	\item \begin{itemize} 
		\item \textbf{Scan 1} for focusing
		\item \textbf{Scan 2} for general movement
		\item \textbf{Scan 3} for high quality image. \red{Click freeze to freeze the scan}
		\item \textbf{Scan 4} for high quality image that also freezes
	\end{itemize}
	\item RP1 - Rotary pump first pumps the diffusion pump, then the chamber, then the diffusion pump works on the chamber
  \end{enumerate}}

   \subsection*{Change filament}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \mi{Gun} \ra \mi{Filament} \ra \cmd{press \mi{Vent}} to vent gun chamber;
  	\item \cmd{Lift cap \ra pull cone out \ra unscrew \red{EXTERNAL SCREWS} with alan key, release the flat screw and take out filament};
  	\item \cmd{Clean with stick polish and cotton pad \ra wash with acetone} so that there is no black; 
  	\item \cmd{Take new filament, put ring on it \ra dip into the cone \red{making sure that small indent on filament is on the opposite end to the slot in the cone}};
  	\item \cmd{Tighten external screws and flat screw \ra use screws in the ``caves of the cone" to adjust filament position};
  	\item \cmd{Slot into SEM \ra press \mi{evac}}.
  	\item When the SEM is working, \cmd{click \mi{gun} and slide the four sliders to get the maximum brightness} to compensate for offsets;
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection*{Beam blanking}
  For \mi{Beam ON/OFF} on Nanomaker we use a blanker. The small module responsible for it is a box made by Deben.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Make sure that it reads \mi{Beam blanking ON 200V};
  	\item \cmd{Change voltage to 200V by \mi{Plate voltage arrows}};
  	\item If beam blanking is inverted in Nanomaker (beam doesn't go off when pressing \mi{beamOff}) \ra \cmd{Press \mi{Beam Status - Blank} button};
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Loading}
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item The loading chamber should be vented already \ra Evac button on screen should be grey.
  	\item \red{Put on a healthy scratch on the resist for good focusing if resist thickness is greater than 100nm}
  	\item Attach the sample onto the doughnut shaped container. Screw on well. Top of sample, must be near the end of the doughnut that is \red{symmetrical}. Should look like two frog legs.
  	 Open door \ra Slide onto the rails \red{if it doesn't want to go in, try a different orientation.} Close the door.
  	\item \texttt{Sample \ra Evac \ra Airlock chamber}, will evacuate the chamber the sample was loaded in to a low pressure. It will beep when done and button stays green. Takes 30sec.
  	\item \red{Turn the open handle, to open the door from the sample stage to the SEM.}
  	\item Raise rod down. \red{Do no touch the rod!!!!!!} Move forward {and twist} to grab hold of the sample. Push the sample all the way in {it becomes hard towards the end} and \red{remember to unlock!!!}. Draw the rod out.
  	\item \red{CLOSE THE DOOR BETWEEN THE SEM AND THE SAMPLE CHAMBER!!}
  	\item Wait 10 minutes for the SEM to pump to low pressure again.
  	\item \texttt{Initial position \ra Go}, to move the sample to the operational area.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Calibrating}
  The following steps calibrate the SEM for operation.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item First of all set the current and voltage to the required values. This is done at the bottom of the program on the screen. $I\approx10pA$ and $V\approx30keV$. The Working Distance (WD)$\approx20mm$. For the 2D flakes, we were at 24pA. \red{The lower the current, the better the precision.} Push the \texttt{MDN} and \texttt{AVG} buttons on current meter to average readings.
  	\item \cmd{Change working distance to 20$ \mu $m for general and 10$ \mu $m for fine structures like meanders};
   	\item \red{\texttt{Turn the SEM on by clicking the HT ON button}.}
   	\item Choose the correct aperture, by pulling lever on the side of the SEM towards you and twisting to the desired selection. Aperture 1 is the smaller - has the best precision. \red{Do not exceed 32 spot size}. Aperture 2 is larger and can sustain spot sizes greater than 40 and is used for imaging.
   	\item \red{\texttt{Ensure that X/Y is chosen on the controller for the movement.}}
  	\item Go to the Coulomb dot (black dot), and zoom in on it. Check that the current is the value that you selected.
  	\item \texttt{Press ACB button}, which automatically adjust the brightness and contrast.
  	\item \texttt{Press R button on the keyboard and align the structure}. If needed, \texttt{click on the sample location on the SEM screen, and manually enter the rotation in degrees that is required.}
  	\item Zoom to $\approx$x200000 onto a nice edgy structure like Rais dots
  	\item \textbf{Wobbling} - \texttt{Tool->OL Wobbler}, will make the image oscillate - essentially if the aperture is at an angle, then going in and out of focus will have the effect of shifting the image. Turn the dials on the rod that sticks out the SEM to reduce the wobbling as much as possible. Turn the wobbler off.
  	\item \textbf{Astigmatism and focus} - \texttt{Press scan 1, to go to the near field. Hold down the focus button, and move up and down to focus. If the focus is different in the horizontal and vertical directions, do the same for the X and Y astigmatism.} 
  	\item \textbf{Gun alignment} - align the gun by \texttt{changing the X Y and Z}, until the current in the coulomb dot, is maximised.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Prepare for use with nanomaker}
  Now that the SEM is calibrated (should be done after each large movement), we need to prepare it to communicate with nanomaker.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item Focus on the scratch or near the sample at x100000;
  	\item Go to the required magnification. E.g. x4000. For graphene flakes it was x350. \red{\texttt{Inst Mag on the keyboard to remember this value}}. This is useful if you need a very high magnification during exposure, but you cant use it during focusing as it would expose the whole resist.
  	\item Move the the required structure. \texttt{INST MAG} and \red{quickly} \texttt{Double click} to center without overexposing.
  	\item \red{On Nanomaker in Sec.\ref{sec:nanomaker} click \texttt{BEAM OFF\ra INST MAG} (if required) \texttt{\ra EXT SCAN ON}}
  \end{enumerate}
  	
  \subsection{Ending session}
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item Zoom out and \red{\texttt{HT off} to turn off the electron gun}.
  	\item \texttt{Sample \ra initial position} to move the sample back for extraction.
  	\item \red{Wait 5 minutes} to allow the tungsten cathode to cool. If you begin venting before this time, TuO strings form on the filament,
  	\item Evacuate the loading chamber \texttt{Sample \ra Airlock chamber \ra Evac}. It will beep when ready and show green button.
  	\item Open the shutter, put the rod in \red{the hold position}, extract. Twist to unlock and place rod.
  	\item \red{Close the shutter once finished.}
  	\item Can take out as soon as required.
  \end{enumerate}


 \subsection{Taking image}
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item \mi{Scan 4} \ra \mi{File} \ra \mi{Save as};
 		\item Take data from the computer underneath the desk.
 	\end{enumerate}
  \newpage

 \section{Nanomaker\label{sec:nanomaker}}
 \subsection{Communication with SEM}
 To pass on control between the SEM and the nanomaker program:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item \texttt{Click the exposure button, or go to File \ra Exposure}.
 	\item \texttt{Select Hardware control to open up a small block of buttons}
 	\item To go from SEM to nanomaker: \texttt{Beam Off \ra ExtScan On}.
 	\item To go from nanomaker to SEM: \texttt{ExtScan Off \ra Beam On}.
 	\item Remember, that if the scan need to be done at a high magnification, \texttt{to flick the INST Mag button} before proceeding.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \subsection{Marker files}
 Marker files are used to align the field, so that the design is exposed in the correct area. For example, changing the current will distort the image taken by the SEM.
 
 However, if one definitely knows the position of some markers, e.g. crosses at $200\mu m$ separation, then one can
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Define that Marker A is at position $(200,50)\mu m$ etc.
 	\item After scanning the image with the SEM, click on the image to define where the center of Marker A is.
 	\item The program will stretch, move, twist the image, so that the positions you clicked on the screen get the coordinates $(200,50)\mu m$ etc.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \red{\LARGE Always load the parameter file when creating markers, opening markers etc. This sets the correct field size (the yellow border). \texttt{Options \ra load PAR.}}
 
 Now how to create marker files
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item \red{It is crucial that you know what magnification you are working on. Otherwise the position of the markers will be for the incorrect working field.}
 	\item \texttt{File \ra new Video control file} to create a marker file.
 	\item \texttt{Marker \ra Define marker} to access the markers in the field. Here you set
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item The size of the field that is going to be used. Too big causes too much exposure. Too small, and you wont be able to locate the markers.
 		\item The coordinate of the field area.
 	\end{enumerate}
 	By default there is a zero marker for the centre of the field. Use it to set the size of the field.
 	\item \texttt{Add Marker} and define its position (usually determined from the file were the marker was designed) and the size of the image that is taken around that position, to help during alignment. Create as many markers as needed. 
 	\item \red{Save as a .mrk file. Ensure that both the file type and the ending .mkr are used.}
 \end{enumerate}
 
 To use the marker files, load them in nanomaker, and make sure we have control on the SEM that is positioned close to the markers.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item \red{\texttt{Video \ra set align parameters \ra reset} to reset any previous adjustments. Do not do this, if you want the field orientation to remain the same.} 
 	\item \texttt{Video \ra Get all Video}, takes a scan of the regions where we defined the markers.
 	\item  \cmd{For fields were markers are very close to exposure field \red{for initial alignment take video on one marker to not expose others} i.e. press \mi{v} instead of \mi{a} and apply shift} \ra \cmd{then do the alignment with all the markers};
 	\item \cmd{If you dont want to use certain markers for aligning, don't set the 's' center point on them} this may be required if many markers keep not aligning;
 	\item For each marker \texttt{Mark \ra select center}, and select where the marker is on the image. \red{\texttt{Video\ra set alignment parameters \ra reset zoom for large patterns \mi{x=1, y=1} to prevent resizing pattern BUT FOR SMALL PATTERNS DONT DO THIS!!!!\ra calculate} to apply the changes.}
 	\item \texttt{Video \ra Get all Video}, to see how the recalculated field aligns with the defined markers. Keep repeating. With each iteration, twisting etc will make sure that the markers you defined, and the markers you select on the screen are aligned. \red{Assumes that we are always working a fixed magnitude.} We can no expose.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \subsection{Taking an image}
 \red{\Huge Always use aperture 2 for currents above 32pA!!!!}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \cmd{Click \mi{SRT}} to rotate the image;
 	\item \texttt{File \ra new Video control file} to create a blank file.
 	\item \cmd{\mi{Mark} \ra \mi{Define Mark} and select 460x320$ \mu m $} to fill up whole sector with image;
 	\item \cmd{Select resolution of image using \mi{Size [pix]}};
 	\item \texttt{Video \ra Get All Video} takes an image of the specified size.
 	\item Save as a \red{.tif and ensure that the file type is also TIF.}
 \end{itemize}
 
 \subsection{Pattern}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \cmd{From autocad, save the image in format \mi{R12/LT2 DXF}, by using \mi{saveAs} and clicking on the drop down arrow next to the file name;}
 	\item \texttt{File \ra New database} to create a blank sheet for working on.
 	\item \red{\texttt{Options \ra Load PAR \ra 350.par}} to load the parameter files for resist, wafer, magnification etc. \red{MUST DO. Choose parameter file in correspondence with the required magnification 350 for large field, 800 for small field.}
 	\item Add a background (for example if you want to design on top of an image that was already taken) \texttt{View \ra redraw \ra background}
 	\item \texttt{View \ra Draw Layers} in order to shift between different layers on the image. Convenient to have all the files in one place. To create a new layer, draw object \texttt{edit \ra change attributes and set new layer.}
 	\item Draw using the standard tools. \red{If overlaps occur, then the regions will be given a higher dose. See proximity correction below to overcome this.} To repeat pattern \cmd{\mi{Transform numeric} \ra set the \mi{dose increment} at each transformation}
 	\item Once drawn, there are two options to set the \% doses:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Apply the proximity correction. \texttt{Proximity \ra Correction \ra Recommended} to get the menu to pop up. Here it depends on the lithography that is being made. But for example for the 2D flakes:
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item $\alpha=0.05\mu m$
 			\item Resist = PMMA 30-40keV
 			\item Substrate = Silicon
 			\item Height = $1\mu m$ \red{OF THE RESIST! Use thickness vs rotation speed graphs to determine this}
 			%				\item Beam = 24pA
 			%				\item Sensitivity = 200
 		\end{itemize}
 		\red{\texttt{Apply proximity correction by pressing SET}} in order for the new parameters to be used. The regions should change colour once this is done.
 		\item For fine structures i.e. DC samples etc, the dose must be set manually. Use the above proximity correction procedure to evaluate the required doses - one will find that the doses are uniform (the structures are so small, that one does not need to account for the wide backscattered Gaussian)
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item \cmd{Select structures \ra \mi{edit\ra change attributes \ra set dose}}. The doses we need to set are:
 			
 			\begin{center}
 				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
 					\textbf{Structure size} & $ \ge 0.2\,\mu $m & $ 0.2\,\mu $m & $ \le 0.1\,\mu $m\\
 					\textbf{Dose \%} & 166 & 181 & 200
 				\end{tabular}
 			\end{center}
 		\end{itemize}
 	\end{enumerate}
 \end{itemize}
 
 \subsection{Preparing and exposing parameters}
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item \texttt{Options \ra Exposure and video \ra \mi{Step/Times}} to set the exposure parameters (\red{note that this is different from the proximity correction above. Above we just varied the \% dosage that we apply to shapes. Here we set the base dose (the 100\% from which the absolute value of the \% doses will be derived)that the electron beam delivers}). This will vary from lithography to lithography, and the values we use are the same as for the proximity correction e.g.
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item $\alpha=0.05\mu m$
 		\item Resist = PMMA 10-40keV
 		\item Substrate = Silicon
 		\item Height = $0.5\mu m$
 		\item I = 24pA
 		\item Dose = 90$ \mu $As/cm$ ^{2} $
 		\item Sensitivity = 200
 	\end{itemize}
 	\red{\texttt{Click OK \ra click the three buttons next to numerical  values} to set parameters!!!}
 	\item If the \mi{area dwell time} is  $ \ge 10\, \mu$s, then you need to increase the step size in the step menu e.g. from 0.1 to 0.125$ \,\mu $m, so that the beam doesn't jump around too fast.
 	\item \red{\texttt{Options \ra Load PAR \ra 350.par}} to load the parameter files for resist, wafer, magnification etc. \red{MUST DO. Choose parameter file in correspondence with the required magnification 350 for large field, 800 for small field.}
 	\item Do the marker alignemnt described above
 	\item \texttt{Layer} to select the layer of the drawing to be exposed.
 	\item A 100\% dose corresponds to the following formula:
 	\begin{equation}
 	\text{Dose} = \frac{I\times \tau}{\text{Pixel}^{2}},
 	\end{equation}
 	\noindent where we set \textbf{Dose}, \textbf{I} in \mi{options \ra times \ra recommended} and \textbf{pixel} in \mi{step size}. The dwell time $ \tau $ evaluated from this \red{must be $ \ge 10\mu $s or the beam will jump around too fast}
 	\item \red{For small structures \cmd{\mi{Options}\ra choose x or y direction \ra \mi{simulate} (in exposure window)} to trace out how beam will jump. Choose X or Y direction where there are fewer jumps (beam jumping is bad)}. Normally no optimistaion is the best!
 	\item Finally click \mi{start} and don't touch the table.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 
 \subsection{Example design for flakes}
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item \red{\texttt{Options \ra Load PAR \ra 350.par}};
 	\item \cmd{Load sample and take image as .tif};
 	\item \cmd{Unload sample};
 	\item \cmd{Start designing (ensure that you still have \mi{350.par}) with the tif image as background};
 	\item \cmd{Apply proximity correction;}
 	\item \cmd{Use screen pointer to find the coordinates of the markers that are in the image. \red{Write them down}};
 	\item \cmd{Create marker files, and put the markers in the coordinates taken above} - this means that the pattern you drew will be mapped to the correct markers;
 	\item \cmd{Load and expose}.
 \end{enumerate}
