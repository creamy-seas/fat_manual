\section{C++ notes and reminders}
 \red{Beware of integer multiplication - it can easily go out or range and give a negative number! Make sure you covnert to doubles first} 

 \begin{itemize}
 	\item To create lib file from a def file:
 	\begin{center}
 		\texttt{Visual studio command prompt (an application) \ra lib.exe /def:foo.def};
 	\end{center}
 	\item ADQAPI.dll contains commands for execution;
 	\item ADQAPI.h contains the function prototypes;
 \end{itemize}

\section{Threading}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item 4-core computer downstairs;
 	\item Do not let threads access the same variables;
 \end{itemize}

\section{Project Compilation}
 \subsection{Compilation}
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Create the project;
 	\item Copy \cmd{ADQAPI.lib, AQQAPI.h, fftw3, libfftw3-3.dll, libfftw3-3.lib} to ./lib and add them to the relevant lib tab in solutions explorer;
 	\item Right click on the project in the sidebar \ra properties \ra linker \ra input and enter \cmd{ADQAPI.lib} into \cmd{additional dependencies};
 	\item Add \cmd{\#include ``ADQAPI.h"/``fftw3.h''} into the cpp file you need them in;
 	\item Next to \cmd{debug \ra Solution platform} to x64 or x86 depending on the library being used. x86 is good enough for most parts.
 	\item \cmd{General \ra Output Directory \ra \mi{\$(ProjectDir)bin}}
 	\item \cmd{General \ra Intermiediate Directory \ra \mi{\$(ProjectDir)build}}
 	\item \red{To run a DLL (C++ or python) it needs to be in the project folder.} Project options \ra Debugging \ra Enivronment \ra \cmd{PATH=\%PATH\%;\$(ProjectDir)lib}.
 \end{enumerate}
 \subsection{Linking External Libraries}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item A static library (.lib) is copied fully into program;
	\item A program that uses a DLL library (.dll), will only load it's functions at run time. For this to happen, the dll file must exist at run time:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It still requires a .lib file;
		\item This lib file contains wrapper functions, that the linker puts into the main program. It's fast for the linker to do this;
		\item At run time function called -> stub found in .lib (function calling function from dll) \ra dll function called;
		\item To link a library:
		\iframe{
			\texttt{Linker \ra General \ra Additional Library Directories = \$(ProjectDir)lib} 
				\vspace{1em}
				
			\texttt{Input -> Additional Dependencies -> libfftw3.lib}}
	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}

 \subsection{Important Errors with Digitiser}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Use ADC capture lab to connect to device. If in the log window it says \mi{Device not found}.
  	
  	\cmd{Turn off the computer the PXIe-1065 box. Turn the box on \ra turn computer on};
  	\item Do NOT run ADCaptureLab and attempt to communicate via C++ or something;
  	\item Once buffers have been allocated, make sure that for GetData, the third argument number of bytes per buffer element, must be set to the type size of the buffer. For int it should be 4. For short it should be 2;
  	\item LabView operates in 32 bit mode (i.e. x86, and therfore DLLs made for it must be run in x86 debug mode + need to use the 32bit ADQAPI libraries);
  	\item Calibration is $ 2^{16} $ levels/2.2V = 29789.1levels/Volt so resolution is 33$ \mu $V;
	\item Max out the number of samples and minimize number of records;
  \end{itemize}

\section{Making a DLL}
 \iframe{To make DLL suppose the project name is \texttt{Ilya\_Dll}}
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Create header file, defining the functions that are in the DLL for export and import
 	\iframe{
 		\texttt{\#ifdef ILYA\_DLL\_EXPORTS} \hfill \textit{\red{derived from the project name}}
 			
		\texttt{\#define ANYNAME\_declspec(dllexport)}	\hfill  \textit{\red{this macro is use when DLL is being made by VS}}
			
		\texttt{\#else}
		
		\texttt{\#define ANYNAME\_declspec(dllimport)}   \hfill \textit{\red{this macro is used when DLL is used by LabView to import the functions}}
		
		\texttt{extern "C" ANYNAME void name(parameters etc); 	}
 	}
  \item Create .cpp file, where the ADQAPI functions are wrapped inside these exporting/importing functions;
  \item Build \ra Build Ilya\_DLL;
  \item \red{LabView \ra \cmd{call library function node} \ra double click and navigate to the DLL, created in the projects debug folder WILL NOT WORK!!!!!}
  !!!!!!
  
  In the LibraryName or path box, enter
  \iframe{
  	\texttt{ADQAPI.} \hfill \textit{\red{this takes the DLL from C:/Windows/SysWOW64/ADQAPI.dll}. The star makes this import platform independent}
  
  Alternatively, I copied that DLL into the LabView folder, gaves it a name such as Imperium\_ADQ.dll and imported `Imperium.dll' and it worked
  }
	\item Or just use the libraries made by SPDevices. I am using the DLL in ADQAPI folder!! For declaring the parameters types (replicate the names from the function data sheet)
	
	\iframe{
	Thread: Run in UI thread
	
	Calling convention: C
	
	Error checking: default
	
	void*    	    \ra	       numeric, unsigned 32-bit integer, value	(adq\_cu\_ptr)	uint32\_t
	
	unsigned int   \ra	       numeric, unsigned 32-bit integer		(adq214\_num)	uint32\_t
	
	int      	    \ra	       numeric, singed 32-bit integer				int32\_t}
 \end{enumerate}
