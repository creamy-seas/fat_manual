  Lifehack - to close lines run the command \texttt{pedit}.
\end{framed}

\begin{itemize} 
\item \cmd{jbxwriter  \ira \mi{Stage control} \ira  \mi{Fixed Position = ORG}  \ira Move}. The
  \mi{Current Position} should be close to X$\approx$Y$\approx$100$\mu$;
\item \cmd{Turn the black and red lock open};
\item \cmd{Press flashing green \mi{LOAD/UNLOAD} button and hold for 3 seconds}. You will hear
  valve opening;
\item  \cmd{Grab cassette  - it  should naturally  tip to  safe position};  \red{Do not  touch
    corners - they are used for height measurements. If dirty clean with IPA}\ec;
\item Load in the chip or wafer, performing alignment as in Sec.~\ref{sec:marker_location};
\item Load cassette as below

  \end{figure}

\item \cmd{\mi{Load, unload} \ira wait 3 seconds};
\item \cmd{Check \mi{Manual Loader Viewer} in jbxwriter \ira Blue means cassette is loaded};
\item It is recommended to wait one hour  after loading for the temperature to stabilise.  The
  temperature    fluctuations    can    be     checked    following    steps    outlined    in
  sec.~\ref{Temperaturefluctuations}.  During  the exposure the temperature  should not change
  more than $0.05$ degrees Celsius. If the exposure is short it might not be necessary to wait
  a full hour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Finding the markers before loading}
\label{sec:marker_location}

To align the chip in the JEOL, you need to tell \cmd{jbxwriter} the location of the \texttt{PQRS} and first chip in the coordinates of the cassette. This is done on the microscope next to the door.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \def\svgwidth{8cm}\import{images_inkscape/}{marker_position.pdf_tex}

 \subsection{Creating pattern\label{subsec:jobMaker}}
 Claibrating  the  EBL is  all  good.  We also  need  to
 prepare the  pattern that  it will  expose. Do  this in
 \verb|EB Job Maker|. The main goals are:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Define the coordinates of the global markers:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \mi{Job property};
   \item Select Window position on the sample holder you
     are using (A, B, C ,D);
   \item Select the window size. Big wafers are 3" and a
     2x2 chip fits a 2";
   \item Define the coordinates  of the global markers P
     and Q  \red{using the coordinate and  offset values
       you  found during  calibration. Yes  - just  copy
       them.}
   \item  \cmd{Tick other  properties  such as  current,
       calibration file etc.}
   \end{itemize}
 \item Select the .v30 pattern to expose \ra Right click
   to make an array of them;
 \item \cmd{Right click on  the pattern} \ra \cmd{Define
     the  position  of  the  chip  mark  for  the  first
     pattern. If you want to offset the pattern to be in
     betwen the chips \red{apply (-402,-460) offset}};
 \item \cmd{Save and load it up for exposure.}
