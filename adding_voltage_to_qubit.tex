 \section{Adding gate voltage to qubits}
 For  some experiments  we  add a  gate voltage  to  the system.   The
 circuit for this setup is the following:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=7cm]{gate}
\end{center}

The   resistor  is   there   to  damped   any   noise.   The   voltage
$ \approx  5\, $V  is then  felt by the  qubit system  across from  the gate
electrode.
