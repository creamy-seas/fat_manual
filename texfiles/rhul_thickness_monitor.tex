  Used to measure the thickness and width of devices.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item \cmd{Load computer using password \quote{nanouser}\ira open \quote{alpha set program} \ira log on with \quote{administrator}, password \quote{administrator}};
  	\item \cmd{Position sample \red{make sure pin is raised!};}
  	\item \cmd{Double click \quote{down arrow}} to move the pin down. \cmd{Click \quote{up arrow}} to move pin up for fine adjustments;
  	\item \cmd{Turn the knobs to position sample.} Use on screen camera to choose position;
  	\item \cmd{Set the}
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Scan length (e.g. 1000$ \mu $m)- the distance the scan carries over;
  		\item Scan speed (50$ \mu m /s$)- how quickly scan is made;
  		\item Sampling rate (50Hz)- how fine measurements are made;
  	\end{itemize}
  	Together these dictate the scan time and the resolution. 

	\item Once ready \cmd{press start to take scan.} \red{Do not touch table!};
	\item \cmd{Click levelling \ira select \quote{level 2 zones} \ira move the white bars on top graph to area of flat regions for averaging \ira } should create a rectangle like structure on the graph \ira \cmd{click \quote{OK}};
	\item \cmd{Use \quote{LL} and \quote{RR} bars to measure width (separation between them) and height (height difference between them);}
	\item \red{\cmd{Double Press \quote{UP}!!}} to lift pin \ira \cmd{remove the wafer.}
